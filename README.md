### User Side

A simple yet effective **e-commerce demo application** built to enhance my skills in **Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, JPA, Redis, and Database management**. The project demonstrates a dynamic and functional e-commerce system with both **user-facing features** and an **admin/manager control panel**.

## üöÄ Features

### User Side

* **Category browsing**: Users can select categories and view the products inside.
* **Shopping cart with Redis**: Add, remove, increase or decrease products in the cart. Cart state is managed using Redis (port 6379).
* **Account management**:

  * Update personal details.
  * Delete account (with confirmation email notification).
  * Register a new account with input validation patterns.
  * Email verification link sent upon registration (expires in 5 minutes). If not confirmed, account is deleted and a notification email is sent.
* **Login & Security**: Users cannot log in unless their account is activated.

### Admin/Manager Panel

* **User management**: Admins can add new admins and managers.
* **Category management**: Create new categories.
* **Product management**: Add, update, and manage products dynamically (reflected immediately on user and cart views).
* **Dashboard & Analytics**:

  * Total users, active users, new registrations.
  * Category-based product statistics.
  * Graph showing active vs total users.

### Technical Features
